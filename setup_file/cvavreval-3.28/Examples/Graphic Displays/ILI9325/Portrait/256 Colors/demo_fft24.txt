This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the
glcd_ili9325.lib file is supplied only with the
Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\ILI9325\Exe\demo_fft24.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A 240x320 2.4" TFT LCD module is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the ILI9325 controller.

In this demo the controller is operated in 256 color mode.

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTE bit 0
DB1  - PORTE bit 1
DB2  - PORTE bit 2
DB3  - PORTE bit 3
DB4  - PORTE bit 4
DB5  - PORTE bit 5
DB6  - PORTE bit 6
DB7  - PORTE bit 7

DB8  - PORTF bit 0
DB9  - PORTF bit 1
DB10 - PORTF bit 2
DB11 - PORTF bit 3
DB12 - PORTF bit 4
DB13 - PORTF bit 5
DB14 - PORTF bit 6
DB15 - PORTF bit 7

/WR  - PORTD bit 3
/RD  - PORTD bit 2
RS   - PORTD bit 1
/RST - PORTD bit 4
/CS  - PORTD bit 0

Backlight connections:
BLGND - GND
BLVDD - +3.3V

Power supply connections:
GND - GND
+3.3V - +3.3V

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
