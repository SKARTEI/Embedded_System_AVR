This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ssd1963.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\Resistive Touchscreen\SSD1963 480x272\Release\Exe\demo_rtouch.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

In this demo the SSD1963 controller operates in 
8 bit interface mode.
For better performance the 16 bit operating mode can
be selected by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
In this situation the DB8-DB15 signals must be also
connected to one of the ATxmega128A1 ports.   

An ER-TFTM043-4 480x272 4.3" TFT LCD module
from www.buydisplay.com is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the SSD1963 controller. 

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTC bit 0
DB1  - PORTC bit 1
DB2  - PORTC bit 2
DB3  - PORTC bit 3
DB4  - PORTC bit 4
DB5  - PORTC bit 5
DB6  - PORTC bit 6
DB7  - PORTC bit 7

DB8  - not connected
DB9  - not connected
DB10 - not connected
DB11 - not connected
DB12 - not connected
DB13 - not connected
DB14 - not connected
DB15 - not connected

/CS  - PORTE bit 0
D/C  - PORTE bit 1
/RD  - PORTE bit 2
/WR  - PORTE bit 3
/RST - PORTE bit 4

Backlight control - PORTD bit 5

VSS   - GND
VDD   - +5V  (Jumper J8 NOT SET, the ER-TFTM043-4 display 
              module uses its own 3.3V voltage regulator)

ADS7846 touch screen controller connections:
/CS     - PORTF bit 0
DCLK    - PORTF bit 1
DIN     - PORTF bit 2
DOUT    - PORTF bit 3
/PENIRQ - PORTF bit 4

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic Display and
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Resistive Touchscreen
menus.
