This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ssd1289.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\Resistive Touchscreen\SSD1289\Release\Exe\demo_rtouch.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A 240x320 HY32D 3.2" TFT LCD module is used for
the purpose of this demo.
See: http://www.hotmcu.com/32-touch-screen-tft-lcd-with-16-bit-parallel-interface-p-36.html
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the SSD1289 controller. 

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTE bit 0
DB1  - PORTE bit 1
DB2  - PORTE bit 2
DB3  - PORTE bit 3
DB4  - PORTE bit 4
DB5  - PORTE bit 5
DB6  - PORTE bit 6
DB7  - PORTE bit 7

DB8  - PORTC bit 0
DB9  - PORTC bit 1
DB10 - PORTC bit 2
DB11 - PORTC bit 3
DB12 - PORTC bit 4
DB13 - PORTC bit 5
DB14 - PORTC bit 6
DB15 - PORTC bit 7

/WR  - PORTD bit 3
/RD  - PORTD bit 2
D/C  - PORTD bit 1
/RST - PORTD bit 4
/CS  - PORTD bit 0

Backlight connections:
BLGND - GND
BLVDD - +3.3V

Power supply connections:
GND - GND
+5V - +5V

ADS7843 touch screen controller connections:
/CS     - PORTF bit 0
DCLK    - PORTF bit 1
DIN     - PORTF bit 2
DOUT    - PORTF bit 3
/PENIRQ - PORTF bit 4

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic Display and
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Resistive Touchscreen
menus.
