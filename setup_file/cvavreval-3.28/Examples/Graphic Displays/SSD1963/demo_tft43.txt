This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ssd1963.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\SSD1963\Exe\demo_tft43.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel Xplain
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A large portion of the program (51712 bytes)
consists of the uncompressed 186x139 64k color
image from the file image.c
Due to the limited number of I/O pins of the Xplain
board, there was no possibility to connect a SD CARD
and store this image on it, so for the purpose of this demo,
it was located in chip's FLASH memory.
The image was left uncompressed in order to allow fast loading.

In this demo the SSD1963 controller operates in 
8 bit interface mode.
For better performance the 16 bit operating mode can
be selected by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
In this situation the DB8-DB15 signals must be also
connected to one of the ATxmega128A1 ports.   

An ER-TFTM043-4 480x272 4.3" TFT LCD module
from www.buydisplay.com is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the SSD1963 controller. 

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTA bit 0
DB1  - PORTA bit 1
DB2  - PORTA bit 2
DB3  - PORTA bit 3
DB4  - PORTA bit 4
DB5  - PORTA bit 5
DB6  - PORTA bit 6
DB7  - PORTA bit 7

DB8  - not connected
DB9  - not connected
DB10 - not connected
DB11 - not connected
DB12 - not connected
DB13 - not connected
DB14 - not connected
DB15 - not connected

/CS  - PORTD bit 0
D/C  - PORTD bit 1
/RD  - PORTD bit 2
/WR  - PORTD bit 3
/RST - PORTD bit 4

Backlight control - PORTD bit 5

VSS   - GND
VDD   - +5V  (Jumper J8 NOT SET, the ER-TFTM043-4 display 
              module uses its own 3.3V voltage regulator)

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
