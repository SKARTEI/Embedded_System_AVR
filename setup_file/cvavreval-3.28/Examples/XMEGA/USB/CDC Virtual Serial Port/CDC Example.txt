CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.13 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel STK600 development board, using
an ATxmega128A4U chip.

This program exceeds the allowed code size
of the Evaluation version.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A4U FLASH memory with
the contents of the \Exe\CDC Example.hex file.

The chip uses the internal 32 MHz RC oscillator,
adjusted and calibrated to 48 MHz using the
DFLL and USB Start Of Frame.
The CPU and Peripheral Clock frequency are set to 12 MHz.

The STK600-TQFP44 socket and STK600-RC044X-55 routing
cards are used for interfacing the chip with
the STK600.

The LEDs are connected to PORTA pin 0..7 outputs.
For this purpose use a 10 pin ribbon cable to connect
the PORTA and LED headers.

The CDC Virtual Serial Port uses the Windows serial driver.
