Creation, writing, appending, reading, attribute and time stamp changing
of a file on a MMC/SD/SD HC card example for the CodeVisionAVR V3.24+
compiler.

The example is intended to be run on the Atmel STK600
development board that use an ATxmega256C3 chip.
A STK600-RC064X-14 addapter board is used.
The chip is clocked from the internal 32MHz oscillator.

A Micro SD card socket is connected to the development board
as outlined below:

Card Socket      ATxmega256C3
/CS ------------ PORTC bit4
SI  ------------ PORTC bit5 MOSI
SO  ------------ PORTC bit6 MISO
SCK ------------ PORTC bit7 SCK
GND ------------ GND
+3.3V ---------- +3.3V

The /CD and WP signals are disabled in the project configuration,
because a Micro SD card socket without these signals was used.

For other I/O port connections, you need to make the appropriate changes in the
"Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|MMC/SD/SD HC Card and FAT Support"
menu.

The ATxmega256C3 USARTD0 is used for communication.
Connect
PORTD bit 2 - RS232 Spare RXD
PORTD bit 3 - RS232 Spare TXD


The CodeVisionAVR Terminal is used for displaying data received from the
development board.
The Terminal must be configured for:

Baud Rate: 9600
Data Bits: 8
Parity: None
Stop Bits: 1
Emulation: TTY
Handshaking: None
Append LF on Reception: OFF
Appearance|Rows: 40
Appearance|Columns: 80

If you are using the CodeVisionAVR Evaluation version, you may program into
the FLASH the precompiled SDCARD_XM.HEX file found in the
\Examples ATxmega\SDCARD\C3\EXE directory
