/**************************************************************************
Modified and optimized for the CodeVisionAVR V2.0 C Compiler
by Pavel Haiduc, HP InfoTech s.r.l. (C) 2009-2015

V1.0 July 2009 - initial R0.07c
V1.1 May  2011 - updated to R0.07e, improved speed and code size
V1.2 September 2011 - added and modified the f_mkfs function from R0.09
V1.3 September 2014 - setting _FS_READONLY to 1 removes the declarations
                      for functions that write to the SD card (29092014_1)
V1.4 March 2015     - modified the definitions for _FS_READONLY,
                      _FS_MINIMIZE, _FS_TINY, _FS_RPATH, _FS_REENTRANT,
                      _USE_MKFS, _USE_FORWARD, _USE_LFN, _CODE_PAGE, 
                      _DRIVES, _MULTI_PARTITION macros, so that they can 
                      be globally defined in the project configuration
